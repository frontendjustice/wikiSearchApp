Hello...

This project was created using HTML, TailwindCSS and a little bit JavaScript for the Api work.

Project Description:
A search app that uses wikipedia api for its job.

This is actually my final project from the DSC Unilag Javascript Track and it was fun building this. And one more thing... Check out the Dark Mode of the site, its dope.
